mosquitto open source mqtt broker test programs that measures message delivery jitter.

Compiled, run and tested on Linux (CentOS 5.6) and MacOS X (Lion) platforms. Should compile and run on other platforms where mosquitto is ported.

Requirements:
  Reasonable C compiler (GCC)
  mosquitto >= 0.13
  sqlite3
  make (GNU Make >=3.81)

mqproducer: 
-----------
Produces the topic messages with given qos, payload size and frequency. Last topic message is send without payload to flag consumers that "this is the last topic message".

Usage: mqproducer -t <topicname>
                  [-q <qos> (0-2)]
                  [-d <debuglevel> (0-3)]
                  [-s <payloadsize> (256B)]
                  [-f <publish-frequency> (1Hz)]
                  [-n <number-of-messages> (1000)]
                  [-h <broker-host> (localhost)]
                  [-p <broker-port> (1883)]
                  -? (prints out this usage)
mqconsumer:
-----------
Simply consumes the topic which is not empty and stops consuming when recevies an empty topic message (i.e empty payload). Calculates and dumps the min/max/average packet delivery transmit and receive jitters.

Usage: mqconsumer -t <topicname>
                  [-q <qos> (0-2)]
                  [-d <debuglevel> (0-3)]
                  [-h <broker-host> (localhost)]
                  [-p <broker-port> (1883)]
                  -? (prints out this usage)
sqconsumer:
-----------
This program is used for multiple producer one consumer tests.  

Subscribes to all topics with name "<topicname>" (topic name should be in the form of '<topic>/+', like 'test/+' without quotes) and stored them in an in-memory sqlite database for further jitter calculations. When it receives <num-topic-types> number of empty topic messages stops consuming and disconnects from the broker. Calculates and dumps the min/max/average packet delivery transmit and receive jitters. 

Usage: sqconsumer -t <topicname>
                 [-n <num-topic-types> (1)]
                 [-q <qos> (0-2)]
                 [-d <debuglevel> (0-3)]
                 [-h <broker-host> (localhost)]
                 [-p <broker-port> (1883)]
                 -? (prints out this usage)
